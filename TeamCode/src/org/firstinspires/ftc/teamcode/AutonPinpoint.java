/**
 * RED Autonomous, version 2: the same two moves as AutonTimedDrive, but the robot decides when to
 * stop by looking at WHERE IT IS instead of at a clock.
 *
 * Two ideas:
 *   ODOMETRY -- the Pinpoint tracks the robot's position on the field. Call update(), read the pose.
 *   FIELD-RELATIVE DRIVING -- the plan is written in field coordinates, and driveFieldRelative()
 *   converts to the robot's own forward/right at the last moment.
 *
 * Watch where it stops: it will NOT be (-19, -59). The robot runs at full DRIVE_POWER right up to
 * the instant the odometry says "close enough," then has to coast. AutonPinpointProportional fixes
 * that; this is the "before" picture.
 *
 * FIELD COORDINATES (official FTC, drawn from the red alliance's side of the field)
 *   origin at field center; x and y each run -72 to +72 inches
 *   +x to your right, +y away from the red wall -- so red wall is y = -72, blue wall is y = +72
 *   heading is degrees counterclockwise from +x:  0 right, 90 up, 180 left, -90 down
 *
 * THE PLAN
 *   start at (-12, -63) facing 180, left side against the red wall
 *   move 1: go to (-12, -59)  -- 4 inches off the wall, scores LEAVE
 *   move 2: go to (-19, -59)  -- 7 inches into the loading zone, scores PARK
 *
 * The plan never says "forward" or "strafe." Start the robot facing a different way and these same
 * two lines still take it to the same two spots on the field.
